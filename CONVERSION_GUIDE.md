# Model Conversion Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the process and code for converting models between various formats. The instructions are intended to help users with a step-by-step guide for converting machine learning models to different formats using appropriate tools and scripts.

## Introduction

Converting models between different formats is essential for deploying them across different platforms and frameworks. This guide outlines methods to convert models while retaining accuracy and compatibility.

## Tools Required

- **ONNX**: Open Neural Network Exchange is a format used to represent deep learning models. It allows interoperability between different machine learning frameworks.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library for Python.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install onnx
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
```

## Conversion Examples

### 1. Converting PyTorch to ONNX

Below is a Python code snippet to convert a PyTorch model to an ONNX format:

```python

        import torch
        from models.wav2lip import Wav2Lip
        
        # Initialize and load your model
        model = Wav2Lip()
        checkpoint = torch.load('/path/to/checkpoint.pth', map_location='cpu')
        if 'state_dict' in checkpoint:
            state_dict = checkpoint['state_dict']
            model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
        else:
            model.load_state_dict(checkpoint)
        model.eval()
        
        # Create dummy inputs
        dummy_audio_input = torch.randn(1, 1, 80, 16)
        dummy_face_input = torch.randn(1, 6, 96, 96)
        
        # Export the model to ONNX
        torch.onnx.export(model, (dummy_audio_input, dummy_face_input), 'wav2lip.onnx')
                    
```

### 2. Converting TensorFlow to ONNX

To convert a TensorFlow model to ONNX format, use the `tf2onnx` library.

```bash
pip install tf2onnx
```

Use the following command to convert the model:

```bash
python -m tf2onnx.convert --saved-model path/to/saved_model --output model.onnx
```

### 3. ONNX to TensorFlow

To convert an ONNX model to TensorFlow, use the `onnx-tf` library:

```bash
pip install onnx-tf
```

Python code to convert ONNX to TensorFlow:

```python
from onnx_tf.backend import prepare
import onnx

# Load the ONNX model
onnx_model = onnx.load("model.onnx")

# Convert ONNX model to TensorFlow
tf_rep = prepare(onnx_model)

# Export the TensorFlow model
tf_rep.export_graph("model_tf")
```

## Conclusion

This documentation outlines the process for converting models between popular machine learning formats. By following the steps, you can facilitate interoperability across different frameworks and improve deployment capabilities.
