# Model Conversion Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the process and code for converting models between various formats. The instructions are intended to help users with a step-by-step guide for converting machine learning models to different formats using appropriate tools and scripts.

## Introduction

Converting models between different formats is essential for deploying them across different platforms and frameworks. This guide outlines methods to convert models while retaining accuracy and compatibility.

## Tools Required

- **ONNX**: Open Neural Network Exchange is a format used to represent deep learning models. It allows interoperability between different machine learning frameworks.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library for Python.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install onnx
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
```

## Conversion Examples

### 1. Converting PyTorch to ONNX

Below is a Python code snippet to convert a PyTorch model to an ONNX format:

```python
import torch
import torch.onnx

# Load your trained PyTorch model
model = torch.load('model.pth')
model.eval()

# Input to the model
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Export the model to ONNX
torch.onnx.export(
    model,                      # model being run
    dummy_input,                # model input (or a tuple for multiple inputs)
    "model.onnx",              # where to save the model
    export_params=True,         # store the trained parameter weights inside the model file
    opset_version=11,           # the ONNX version to export the model to
    do_constant_folding=True,   # whether to execute constant folding for optimization
    input_names=['input'],      # the model's input names
    output_names=['output'],    # the model's output names
    dynamic_axes={'input': {0: 'batch_size'}, 'output': {0: 'batch_size'}} # variable length axes
)

print("Model successfully converted to ONNX!")
```

### 2. Converting TensorFlow to ONNX

To convert a TensorFlow model to ONNX format, use the `tf2onnx` library.

```bash
pip install tf2onnx
```

Use the following command to convert the model:

```bash
python -m tf2onnx.convert --saved-model path/to/saved_model --output model.onnx
```

### 3. ONNX to TensorFlow

To convert an ONNX model to TensorFlow, use the `onnx-tf` library:

```bash
pip install onnx-tf
```

Python code to convert ONNX to TensorFlow:

```python
from onnx_tf.backend import prepare
import onnx

# Load the ONNX model
onnx_model = onnx.load("model.onnx")

# Convert ONNX model to TensorFlow
tf_rep = prepare(onnx_model)

# Export the TensorFlow model
tf_rep.export_graph("model_tf")
```

## Conclusion

This documentation outlines the process for converting models between popular machine learning formats. By following the steps, you can facilitate interoperability across different frameworks and improve deployment capabilities.
